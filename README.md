# UnitTestSample

This is simple sample project for small live TDD coding session during [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OwvIC9jnqOmZJeVwcKEg18jffWWk1LE5ZZl2v1tFIhM/edit?usp=sharing) presentation.


All API classes, data POJOs and layouts (and other resouces) are already added. We should implement RandomActivityTest (yes, write test first! :) and RandomActivity.

This is Gradle Android project so you can easily clone it and import in the Android Studio.
